# Baby Steps of Reinforcement Learning

The step by step guide of Reinforcement Learning with Python.

## Plan before Action: Dynamic Programming

First we think "make plan before action" strategy. It is called "Dynamic Programming".  
Let's experience Dynamic Programming by the cute simulator, and understand its theory from the simple code!

## Experience makes Plan

If the number of states is so huge, "planning" takes much time! So we have to think the order of plan & action, specifically "action first, then fix the plan" strategy.

It's so-called Q-function based strategy or model-free RL. Let's try and understand these by [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)!
